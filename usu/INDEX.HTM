  Here's a picture of me, not good, but who cares?   
  <IMG SRC="./me.jpg"> 
</p>
  I live in North Logan (about two miles from Utah State), and I go to
  Sky View High!  I graduate in '97 (next year, at last)
  I like computers and I play the trumpet, I'm even section leader.
  Watch for Sky View Marching Band this year, we're going to kick some
  butt!  I work at Burger King, which ya know, teaches me to have a 
  positive attitude. I like Ice Cream, Pizza, Books, Sports like Skiing, Ultimate 
  Frisbee (I'll try anything), Conquering the World (Axis & Allies, Risk),
  Computer Games like Wind Commander III, Civilization II, 
  and Babes!  Ya know, Designer jeans, gotta get some Babes!  (Ask Ryan Wentz)  
  I'm going to be 18 in July, on July 18th.    
  I like to have fun and stuff.  Engineering State has been a blast.       
  I have no clue about the web, but I'm liking what I'm learning.  
  Here's some cool places you can find neat stuff:
